// Problem 116: Red, green or blue tiles
// A row of five black square tiles is to have a number of its tiles replaced with coloured oblong tiles chosen from
// red (length two), green (length three), or blue (length four).

// If red tiles are chosen there are exactly seven ways this can be done.

// Possible ways to placing red oblong on a row with length of five units
// If green tiles are chosen there are three ways.

// Possible ways of placing green oblong on a row with length of five units
// And if blue tiles are chosen there are two ways.

// Possible ways of placing blue oblong on a row with length of five units
// Assuming that colors cannot be mixed there are 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 ways of replacing the black tiles in a row measuring five units in length.
// How many different ways can the black tiles in a row measuring fifty units in length be replaced if colors cannot be mixed and at least one colored tile must be used?

// Note: This is related to Problem 117.
