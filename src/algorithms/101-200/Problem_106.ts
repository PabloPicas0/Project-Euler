// Problem 106: Special subset sums: meta-testing
// Let  S(A)
//   represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the following properties are true:

// S(B)â‰ S(C)
//  ; that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
// If B contains more elements than C then  S(B)>S(C)
//  .
// For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.

// Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which n = 4, only 1 of these pairs need to be tested for equality (first rule). Similarly, when n = 7, only 70 out of the 966 subset pairs need to be tested.

// For n = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained need to be tested for equality?

// 613, 923, 1078, 1156, 1195, 1215, 1226, 1233, 1234, 1235, 1237, 1240

// UNSOLVED
// I can get right anwsers for n = 4,7 but don't know how to get to the right anwser for n = 12
// Mabye Im too stupid for this right now
