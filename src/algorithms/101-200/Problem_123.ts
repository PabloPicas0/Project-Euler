// Problem 123: Prime square remainders

// Let p_n be the nth prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let r be the remainder when (p_n−1)^n+(p_n+1)^n is divided by p_n^2.
// For example, when n=3, p3=5, and 43+63=280≡5 mod 25.
// The least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 109 is 7037.
// Find the least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 1010.
